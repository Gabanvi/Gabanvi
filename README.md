# Hey, I'm Gabriela ✨

I'm a Digital Marketing Strategist by day and a C programming enthusiast by night!  
I started learning C in August 2024 with Codecademy, which led me to the challenging one-month bootcamp at School 42.
These two experiences sparked an obsession 🤓, and now I'm excited to share my journey on TikTok [@Gabanvi](https://www.tiktok.com/@gabanvi) 😊.
